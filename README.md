# Project Command

## Requirements
This is a Command, to create a basic __Web-App__. It uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/), so make sure you have it installed on your machine.

If you have installed the command, make sure you have installed [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you are not sure, open your console and type in:  
```node -v``` or ```npm -v```. Now press win+r, so now a new little window should open. Type in: ```%appdata%/npm``` and enter. The __npm__ folder  
should open. There you can drag n drop the ```cmd-file```.

## Use the Command
After this, you should be able to type in every folder in the cmd ```create-project coolProject```. If this works, happy birthday, now you can save time, cause you shouldnÂ´t
create a working-directory for web-apps one more time!

In the ```package.json``` there are some commands:  
  - start: to start a live server with Browsersync
  - build: to build a docker image
  - container: to create a docker-container from a docker-image
  
The Docker-Image and the Docker-Container will be called like the project.
